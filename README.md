# Silica Gel Holder

Silica Gel (Desiccant / Moisture Absorber) Holder for the center of a filament spool.
Especially designed for purefil filament spools but should fit other spools as well.

It has a temperature and humidity sensor in the top.
The top is the lid for the silica gel container and is designed to draw air from the top to read correct values as the sensor has no direct holes to the silica gel container.

The silica gel container has holes where air can circulate but no silica gel balls fall out.

After putting the silica gel holder in you should put it in a bag.
I recommend a vacuum bag.

Designed in Fusion 360.
Dimensions can be altered if needed for another spool.
